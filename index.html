<h3 style="color: #336699; font-size: 28px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Professor Graham Hall</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.7;">Professor Emeritus in Applied Linguistics and TESOL.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
      Graham has been involved in English language teaching for over 30 years, as a teacher, teacher educator and researcher. His book <i>'Exploring English Language Teaching: language in action'</i> (2011/2017) was awarded the BAAL Book Prize, and he edited <i>ELT Journal</i> (2013–17) and <i>The Routledge Handbook of ELT</i> (2015).
    </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
      His most recent publication is <i>'Method and Postmethod in Language Teaching'</i> (Routledge; 2024). Graham's professional interests range from language classroom methodology to critical perspectives on TESOL, teacher research, and the inter-relationship between language learning and migration.

<h3 style="color: #336699; font-size: 28px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Dr Martin Lamb</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">Director of International Education, University of Leeds</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
      Martin has taught and trained English teachers in Indonesia, Bulgaria, Sweden and Saudi Arabia, and joined the University of Leeds in 1999. He has coordinated large-scale TESOL programmes in Oman and China, and currently leads the MA TESOL (China) in partnership with Guangdong University of Foreign Studies.
    </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
      His research explores how teacher personality and classroom practices shape student motivation. A recent British Council-funded project examined what makes English teaching ‘inspiring’ in schools across China and Indonesia.
    </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;"><strong>Keynote Title:</strong> <em>The Emotional Roller Coaster of the First Years of Teaching</em></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
      This talk reflects on the emotional challenges of early-career teachers, and how these shape their identities and professional growth.

<h3>What matters to online English learners: A comparative content and sentiment analysis of learner reviews on YouTube and Coursera </h3>
<p>With the development of technology and physical classrooms closed during the pandemic, online English learning has become increasingly significant for English learners. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in online learning platforms such as Coursera. Understanding how these platforms work for students’ learning process can help identify the main features and provide some recommendations. However, the previous studies mainly focused on the formal English learning platforms such as Coursera and the research related to sentiment analysis in informal learning platforms is relatively limited. This research explores what matters to online English learners using YouTube and Coursera by employing content and sentiment analyses of learners’ reviews of YouTube and Coursera to investigate the key themes/sub themes in learners’ reviews, as well as the emotional preferences and variations in the themes/subthemes. 1000+ reviews were collected from English learning videos on YouTube and Coursera, covering different subjects to identify user reactions, dissatisfaction points, and user preferences between formal (Coursera) and informal (YouTube) learning platforms. User comments were manually coded and some with the assistance of Python under the content and sentiment framework adopted from Lei and Zhang (2021), including four major thematic categories and nine subthemes, covering aspects of course content, instructor traits, learning experience and platform design. Approximately 120 user comments were extracted from each video or learning module. Sentiment analysis divide uses’ reviews into positive, neutral or negative based on the emotional tendency. These findings offer valuable insights into learners' preferences for and dissatisfaction with Coursera and YouTube and practical recommendations for optimizing their English online course creation, user experience implementation, and delivery.   </p>

<h3>On Becoming Autonomous: Exploring Pre-service Teacher Autonomy in Initial Professional Identity with Possible-selves Theory</h3>
<p>I would like to present my study exploring how Vietnamese EFL pre-service teachers construct their professional autonomy and identity during and after their teaching practicum, within the socio-cultural context under the dominance of Confucian heritage and vertical collectivism. Drawing on possible selves theory (Markus &amp; Nurius, 1986), the research investigates how pre-service teachers imagine their future professional roles, navigate institutional expectations, negotiate with supervision and exercise autonomy within public school environments. Through a qualitative design involving reflective narratives, visual elicitation (teacher drawings), and semi-structured interviews, the study captures rich, situated understandings of how autonomy is enacted, challenged, and redefined. Findings highlight the complex interplay between self-perception, cultural expectations, institutional norms, and professional demands and aspirations. The study contributes to the global conversation on teacher autonomy by foregrounding the lived realities of pre-service teachers in non-Western contexts, offering implications for teacher education programs, policy reforms, and culturally responsive pedagogies. This presentation will be of interest to TESOL and Education postgraduates, teacher educators, and practitioners seeking to understand and support teacher identity and autonomy in diverse educational settings.</p>

<h3>Fostering Target Language Use Through Emotionally Supportive Teaching Materials</h3>
<p>I would like to present my project on how to foster target language use in young learners by designing emotionally supportive teaching materials. My topic emerged from a classroom observation at a primary school in Shandong, China, where I noticed that many students were reluctant to speak English due to emotional barriers such as anxiety and fear of making mistakes. Although they knew the vocabulary, they hesitated to participate in speaking tasks.

To address this, I designed three classroom materials: Bravery Cards, Partner Talk Cards, and a Feelings Check-in Board. These tools aim to reduce affective filters, build confidence, and support meaningful peer interaction. The design draws on Krashen’s Affective Filter Hypothesis, Swain’s Output Hypothesis, and Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory.

My presentation will include a brief introduction to the problem, the rationale behind the materials, and how each tool supports emotional safety and language production. I aim to share practical strategies for creating inclusive learning environments that empower young learners to use English more confidently.

<h3>Exploring the Development of English Assessment in the High School Entrance Examination (Zhongkao) in China</h3>
<p>I would like to talk about a topic related to my dissertation: the development and reform of English assessment in the High School Entrance Examination (Zhongkao) in Guangdong province, China. The presentation will focus on the changes in exam formats in different districts over recent years. For example, some districts employ traditional assessment method only assessing students’ reading, writing and grammatical skills, while others have recently introduced listening and speaking tests. 

In addition, it will also present the updates in China’s new English curriculum standards for compulsory education and how these have influenced assessment practices.

Finally, I will introduce a part of my research project, which explores the effectiveness of English exam papers in Zhongkao. The study will analyse the questions and the structure, or arrangement of the papers to see whether they are suitable enough to reflect students’ language levels or align with the requirements of the examination curriculum standards.</p>

<h3>The Effectiveness of Animated Videos for Grammar Learning: A Quasi-Experimental Study in Rural Indonesia </h3>
<p>I would like to present findings from my undergraduate research project on the use of animated videos to enhance English grammar learning in under-resourced rural classrooms. The aim of my presentation is to share how animated videos can improve student engagement and grammar achievement, particularly among eighth graders in a rural Indonesian school. This quasi-experimental study involved two secondary school classes: the experimental group received instruction using animated videos, while the control group followed traditional teaching methods. Pre- and post-tests were used to assess learning progress, and results showed that the experimental group achieved significantly higher scores than the control group, suggesting that animated videos can be an effective tool for grammar instruction.

My presentation will explore key findings, practical implications, and the potential of multimedia in resource-limited educational contexts. I will use slides to share visuals, sample materials, and data, and will end the session with a short Q&amp;A to discuss how digital tools can support equitable learning in rural schools.</p>

<h3>Enhancing the Effectiveness of Films in EFL Listening Classes for Young Learners</h3>
<p>My presentation will focus on enhancing the effectiveness of films in EFL (English as a Foreign Language) listening classes for young learners, particularly in Chinese primary schools. The aim is to address the common issue where film-based activities fail to achieve their intended learning objectives due to factors such as short attention spans, cultural irrelevance, and inappropriate language proficiency levels.  

I will share practical strategies to turn passive viewing into active language learning by integrating task-based approaches, such as pre-listening, while-listening, and post-listening activities. Using the film “Mulan” (1998) as an example, I will demonstrate how selecting culturally relevant and linguistically appropriate materials can boost engagement, reduce cognitive load, and bridge listening and speaking skills. The presentation will also highlight the importance of positive emotions and visual literacy in sustaining young learners' focus and motivation, supported by theories like Krashen's Input Hypothesis and research on working memory.  </p>

<h3>Optimizing the Prewriting Stage to Alleviate Problems in Continuation Writing</h3>
<p>As a novice English teacher in China, I observed that many high school students struggle with continuation writing—a task introduced in recent educational reforms requiring students to extend a narrative text logically and creatively. Drawing from my teaching experience and supported by relevant research, this presentation explores the cognitive and linguistic challenges students face, such as weak text comprehension, lack of cohesion and coherence, and difficulties balancing creativity with structure. I propose that targeted prewriting activities can significantly improve student outcomes in continuation writing tasks. By promoting deeper engagement with source texts, encouraging logical narrative development, and stimulating creative thinking, prewriting not only enhances writing quality but also supports learners' overall language development. This presentation will outline specific classroom strategies—including thematic discussions, sentence-scrambling tasks, and role-playing—to help students prepare more effectively for integrated writing tasks. Attendees will leave with practical ideas for scaffolding the prewriting process to support EFL learners’ academic writing skills.</p>

<h3>demonstrating Materials Adaptation of Senior High School English Government Coursebook in Indonesia</h3>
<p>I would like to talk and demonstrate about how to create an English materials adaptation in Indonesia context. The adapting materials  is an essential process as it enables teachers to select more appropriate materials for their learners, helping them achieve their instructional objectives. Especially in Indonesia, due to its vast geographical conditions with diverse children's abilities and school facilities necessitating special methods to materials usage.  Thus, the aim of my talk is to explore the adaptation of English materials in a school in Indonesian context, examining how cultural considerations and environmental factors influence the modification and application of materials for a single meeting. My talk also will be analysing the teaching-learning contents in a published English book provided by the Indonesian Government for senior high school students grade 1.

<h3>From Exploration to Commitment: How the EDUC 5928 Portfolio Shaped My Dissertation Path</h3>
<p>I would like to provide a personal account of how the portfolio tasks for the EDUC5928 module shaped the focus of my MA TESOL dissertation, which examines the adaptation of textbooks to support Story Continuation Writing Tasks (SCWT) in Guangxi high schools. Initially, my interests in communicative language teaching and policy reform were broad and unfocused. However, Task 1's reflection on my teaching background and the challenges I faced in under-resourced regions gradually helped me to identify SCWT as a contextually meaningful research topic.

Task 2 helped me to articulate a clearer direction by connecting limitations in textbooks with the writing difficulties that students face in SCWT. Task 3, which focused on search strategies, helped me to refine my understanding of key concepts such as 'reading-writing integration', 'genre scaffolding', and 'adaptation frameworks'. Annotating diverse sources in Task 4 deepened my understanding of methodology, particularly mixed-methods design and material evaluation.

The portfolio acted as both a testing ground and a springboard, allowing me to explore, make mistakes, receive feedback and ultimately clarify my research identity. My experience may resonate with peers who are still navigating their dissertation writing. I hope to encourage others to view portfolio tasks as critical stepping-stones in their research development, rather than merely as assignments to complete.</p>

<h3>Using Masuhara's (2003) Alternative Approach to Design Reading Materials</h3>
<p>My presentation will explore how I applied Masuhara’s (2003) alternative approach to design engaging, learner-centered reading materials for Level 3 EFL students. 

I will briefly outline the limitations of the prescribed textbook, such as its lack of authenticity and emotional engagement, and explain why a shift from traditional comprehension- and language-based approaches was necessary. I will then introduce the principles of Masuhara’s model (engaging effect, listening before reading, multidimensional processing, and experience before analysis) and show how I used these principles to design a reading lesson based on an authentic National Geographic article about a lunar eclipse. I aim to share how each lesson phase (pre-, while-, and post-reading) was tailored to support learner motivation, comprehension, and meaningful interaction with the text. 

I plan to present my materials using slides, explain the rationale behind key tasks, and discuss the observed or expected outcomes.

<h3>The important role of translation in English learning</h3>
<p>My presentation explores why translation should play an important role in English language teaching. It focuses on both English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English directions. First, I will explain how translation from English to Chinese helps students understand sentence structures more precisely. Unlike the flowing, bamboo-like progression of Chinese, English sentences often branch structurally, requiring learners to "break down" and interpret sentence meaning logically. Without translation practice, students may grasp only a vague idea of meaning and fail to interpret complex sentences accurately. Translation also deepens students’ appreciation of language and literature—classics like Shakespeare become more vivid and meaningful when translated thoughtfully.

Second, I will address Chinese-to-English translation. Many students struggle with clearly expressing ideas in writing essays because they fail to logically connect detailed information. Translation practice enhances coherence and elegance in English expression. I will share examples, such as awkward literal translations of daily phrases, to show how targeted translation exercises can improve fluency.

Finally, I will propose two methods: contextual vocabulary training, helping students apply word meanings in different contexts, and sentence-level structural analysis to train logical thinking.</p>

<h3>The Development Process and Rationale Behind the Design of the Pedagogical Game: “Fatima’s Quest”</h3>
<p>Fatima’s Quest is a culturally grounded, story-driven vocabulary game designed on Canva. Learners follow Fatima, a passionate book lover, traveling through the land of wisdom to restore meaning after an evil “Jinni” stole meaning from words. The core gameplay involves reading short passages, using contextual clues to infer the correct meanings.

The digital tool aims to help Level 3 ESL learners at the University of Technology and Applied Sciences, Oman to infer word meanings through contextual clues in a dynamic and engaging format. I created the game in response to the need for more interactive, meaningful approaches to vocabulary acquisition in Arab ESL contexts and as a pedagogical intervention to address UTAS students’ low performance in the IELTS reading exam, particularly in vocabulary-related questions.

Sentences are adapted from authentic corpus data (British National Corpus) to ensure exposure to natural language use and varied collocational patterns. The game’s mobile-friendly and asynchronous format also allows learners to engage with vocabulary practice independently, supporting learner autonomy and motivation.

My presentation will go through the development process and rationale behind the design of the game from a pedagogical perspective.

<h3>Addressing Fricative Sound Errors,/θ/ and /ð/, through a Singing-based pronunciation Activity</h3>
<p>This presentation examines the effectiveness of singing-based pronunciation activities in helping 
Indonesian learners overcome common difficulties with the English fricative sounds /θ/ (as in think) and /ð/ (as in this). 
These sounds are not present in the Indonesian language, leading many learners to substitute them with more familiar 
sounds such as /t/, /d/, /s/, or /z/. Traditional pronunciation drills often feel mechanical and fail to maintain learner 
engagement. In response, this study introduces a creative approach using songs that feature frequent /θ/ and /ð/ sounds, 
allowing learners to practice these challenging sounds in a natural, enjoyable, and memorable way. This presentation will 
discuss the design of the activity, showcase sample materials, and highlight its pedagogical implications. The findings suggest
that music-based pronunciation practice can be a practical and engaging strategy for addressing segmental errors in Indonesian 
EFL classrooms.</p>

<h3>Learners' Difficulties in Processing Rapid Speech and Recognizing Vocabulary in Listening Activities</h3>
<p>I would like to talk about one of my assignments in EDUC5901 module discussing about the problems in teaching and learning language skills in my classroom context. During my years of teaching English to speakers of foreign language, I noticed that the learners were frequently struggling in listening comprehension. The major problems were coming from their inability to keep up with the listening speed and recognize the vocabulary which lead to difficulty in processing the information to complete the task.  In my classroom situation, the learners often requested to decrease the speed, however the students need to be familiar with the actual speed because that is how communication happens in real life situation (Ur, 2012). Therefore, the aim of my talk is to present the specific challenges faced by my students as a foreign language in listening activities and to propose possible classroom strategies to address those problems based on the theories. I plan to give a shor presentation with slides, followed by a Q&amp;A with the audience. </p>
